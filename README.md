# AI Powered News Search App (Level-1)
# Project Summary:
  The web is considered as the repository of huge volume of data and it is get generated every day. The firms make use of this data to gain understanding, strategies to make a plan as well as finding different kinds of opportunities. To make this scenario even better, enriched news data drives the application to provide faster responsive current events by making dynamic connections across the web.

# INTRODUCTION
  Today in this technological world searching for recent news is one of the primary task in day to day’s life. The news  can be gathered from many ways  such as by reading newspapers, tuning our television for appropriate news channels, tuning our radios, through social media etc., But whether the news from these sources are true and accurate?. It’s a big question mark. To find the solution to these problems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a vital role. This project deals with the news searching methodology which is based on Artificial Intelligence.

# Existing problem
  The news can be gathered from many ways such as by reading newspapers, tuning our television for appropriate news channels, tuning our radios, through social media etc., The user has been required to search manually from these sources to get the required information. It is often time consuming for the users to get the appropriate information.

# Proposed solution
  The technology often provides solution to any kind of unsolvable problems. In such a way that above mentioned problem will also be rectified by using the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Cloud technology. To get the most relevant information for user query, Watson discovery from IBM cloud plays a significant role in handling this situation. It crawls the data collection to provide the information and this prevents the user from searching it manually. This application has been deployed in IBM cloud so that it saves time for the user to search for the appropriate news that happening around the world. The user can able to get the news from anywhere and at any time.

1.  The user interacts with the user interface (UI) created using Node-Red.
2.  The query from the user sends to the Watson discovery of IBM cloud.
3.  The Watson Discovery Service is continually crawling the web to update its Discovery News collection.
4.  Watson discovery sends the requested news through the Node-Red app to the user.<br>
5, 6. Watson discovery also responds to the Slack search requests through the AI-news-bot.

# RESULTS
  The News search application which is based on Artificial Intelligence and cloud technology which aims to provide appropriate news articles based on the user requested query. This has been done by utilizing the concept of Watson discovery from IBM and it continually crawls the news collection to provide the news to the users rather than searching it manually. Initially the user sends the query to the Watson discovery and then the discovery gets the news from the collection and it provides to the users. This application also designed to respond to the slack search requests. The AI based news search application has been deployed in IBM cloud so that it can able to provide service to the user anywhere and at any time.<br>
  
  Moreover this application has been designed to provide the results automatically rather than searching them manually and it also reduces time to search for news articles and also it provides the sentimental analysis of the results.

# Summary
The web application has been created for searching the news which is based on artificial intelligence technology and cloud technology. The users can able to search the news by querying the Watson discovery through the user interface (UI) created using Node-Red editor. The Watson discovery which is incorporated into the node-red can able to crawl the news collection to provide the appropriate news to the users. The users can able to get the news through slack medium by utilizing a news bot called AI-news-bot that has been configured into it which also utilizes Watson discovery to retrieve the news. This helps users to request and get response in a more interactive manner. In a nutshell the AI based news search app is used to retrieve the news based on user requested query by utilizing the Watson discovery service from IBM cloud and also able to respond to the slack search requests.
