# AI Powered News Search App (Level-1)
# Project Summary:
The web is considered as the repository of huge volume of data and it is get generated every day. The firms make use of this data to gain understanding, strategies to make a plan as well as finding different kinds of opportunities. To make this scenario even better, enriched news data drives the application to provide faster responsive current events by making dynamic connections across the web.

# INTRODUCTION
Today in this technological world searching for recent news is one of the primary task in day to day’s life. The news  can be gathered from many ways  such as by reading newspapers, tuning our television for appropriate news channels, tuning our radios, through social media etc., But whether the news from these sources are true and accurate?. It’s a big question mark. To find the solution to these problems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a vital role. This project deals with the news searching methodology which is based on Artificial Intelligence.

# Existing problem
The news can be gathered from many ways such as by reading newspapers, tuning our television for appropriate news channels, tuning our radios, through social media etc., The user has been required to search manually from these sources to get the required information. It is often time consuming for the users to get the appropriate information.

# Proposed solution
The technology often provides solution to any kind of unsolvable problems. In such a way that above mentioned problem will also be rectified by using the concept of Artificial Intelligence and Cloud technology. To get the most relevant information for user query, Watson discovery from IBM cloud plays a significant role in handling this situation. It crawls the data collection to provide the information and this prevents the user from searching it manually. This application has been deployed in IBM cloud so that it saves time for the user to search for the appropriate news that happening around the world. The user can able to get the news from anywhere and at any time.
